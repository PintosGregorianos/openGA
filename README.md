openGA
======

openGA is a simple and object oriented library for genetic algorithm implementation. It can be used as a multi-purpose engine for optimization problems, best fit discovery and generic function weighting.

Features
-------
- Object oriented Population, Simulation and Engine.
- Elitism ability.
- Mutation ability.
- Natural selection by non-uniform probability distribution.
- Three types of crossover: One Cut, Two Cut and Cut Splite.
- CallBack for automatic fitness computation.
- Two goal achievement: Generation and Divergence
- Single engine for normal iteration use.
- Thread engine for silent background operation.
- Cluster engine for network distributed computation.

Developers
---------
The engine is developed by:
- Diego Pinto
- Gregory Gusberti
